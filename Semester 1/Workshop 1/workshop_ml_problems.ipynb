    "Two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples.\n",
    "The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data\n",
    "(median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality \n",
    "between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). \n",
    "  \n",
    "1. Number of Instances: red wine - 1599; white wine - 4898. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Number of Attributes: 11 + output attribute\n",

    "   Note: several of the attributes may be correlated, thus it makes sense to apply some sort of\n",

    "### Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will design a model which predicts the quality of **RED** wine based on the input features. In order to achive this we will perform some initial investigations, preperation, and visiualisation of the data. We will then train decition trees to distinguish good vs bad  **red** wines, and check the validity of our model on a testing dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working through the problems\n",
    "* Try and calculate the answers provided. \n",
    "* Keep code understandable and reproducible, i.e. the notebook can be **restarted** and **re-run**. You will need to do this when work is marked, so better to start practicing.\n",
    "* If you are unsure on how to proceed please reference the two companion notebooks for relevant examples, or **ask one of the TAs**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes on solution\n",
    "* This CP exercise sheet is divided into three sections, corresponding to parts of the lecture. The problems will **not** be marked.\n",
    "  - Data science tools \n",
    "  - Visualisation \n",
    "  - Decision tree classification + ensemble methods\n",
    "* Exercises 1-5 can be solved with one line of code while still being legible. _(That's not a weird flex, nor required, just letting you know that if you find yourself with a 20-line long solution, it can probably be done in a simpler way.)_\n",
    "* The following `pandas.DataFrame` functions may be useful: `head`, `describe`, `loc`, `query`, `unique`, `value_counts`, `sort_values`, `group_by`, `apply`, `transform`."
